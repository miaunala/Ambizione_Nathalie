Labour in fact supported the formation of a Jewish state since around 1917 and continued to support Israel while it struggled for survival after 1948 and through the various wars with its neighbours. I think it was a good piece of work and very necessary, but the point I am making is that the support of Israel through all those times and to the recent past does fly in the face of some of the nonsense that some of the hard left types would post in here as if Keir Starmer invented Labours support of Israel, when he pretty much carries on a long standing tradition. He backed their right to respond to Hamas but has obviously changed position when it became evident that Netanyahu and co were not respecting international law.",negative,0.4845667779445648,0.007193004712462425,0.0008933902718126774,0.001945153228007257,0.0021587959490716457,0.004178657196462154,0.0006813298678025603,0.00023324145877268165

Soooo the little bit of tax the Tories save ordinary working people (masses more for the richer) will hardly touch the charges made by these companies for delivering the, once, publicly owned services.  Profit will make some individuals obscenely rich or pay dividends to shareholders- never to be seen again by you or I.  And these companies and individuals are past masters at avoiding/ evading taxes. A great system for transferring wealth into a minority of pockets and leaving nothing for you and me.  The latest Tory depiction of Starmer is the usual emotive propoganda believed by so many:-( Tory PRIVATISATION will cost us FAR, FAR MORE üò≠üò≠ MY MUM WILL PAY NEARLY ¬£70,000 THIS YEAR IN HER CARE HOME.

Those are the words of a reform candidate this week. You obviously dont care what sort of world any children or other young relatives grow up in, by supporting clueless climate change denying reform. Thats along with their racism & homophobia & now to top it all off Farage supports Putin. Funny how during brexit he was forever on about sovereignty & borders. But doesnt think Ukraine should defend theirs. But as everything with reform its someone else's fault. Its the West & NATO's fault. I cant remember any of them invading Ukraine. But then those 2 vile campaigners for Farage spouted racist, homophobic comments & it was Channel 4's fault. Despite the fact one of them was a friend of Farage, so he knew exactly what he was like. Farage lied to everyone over brexit that is costing the UK over ¬£4 billion a year & rising. So to believe him again makes reform voters very gullible or very stupid. Or youre just racist, homophobic & dont believe in climate change.

You obviously dont care what sort of world any children or other young relatives grow up in, by supporting clueless climate change denying reform. Thats along with their racism & homophobia & now to top it all off Farage supports Putin. Funny how during brexit he was forever on about sovereignty & borders. But doesnt think Ukraine should defend theirs. But as everything with reform its someone else's fault. Its the West & NATO's fault. I cant remember any of them invading Ukraine. But then those 2 vile campaigners for Farage spouted racist, homophobic comments & it was Channel 4's fault. Despite the fact one of them was a friend of Farage, so he knew exactly what he was like.
