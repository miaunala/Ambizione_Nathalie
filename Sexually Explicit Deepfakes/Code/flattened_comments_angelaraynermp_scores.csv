They have backtracked on; the green pledge, working with unions, stopping the privatisation of the NHS, stopping austerity, protecting LGBTQIA, taxing the super rich, scrapping two child benefit cap, reintroducing the cap on bankers bonuses etc etc etc, the list goes on. (They also are refusing to up universal credit by £40 a week, increasing minimum wage to £15 an hour for all over 16, no serious rent controls) I too was once a lifelong Labour voter but they are not the party of the past. Tony Benn would not be in support of who they have become today. Whilst Starmer, Rayner and many of the other shadow cabinet members accept funds from groups like Labour Friends of Israel their priorities will not be with people and the planet. Instead their priorities are profits and power. Wealth inequality is at such a huge margin, and only set to increase under Labour as they are now, none of the next generation will be able to afford to buy homes. We are sliding back to very scary times. We have fascism in action and we know where that took the world to 100 years ago. I wish that Labour were going to offer change, but they are not going to and living under that false hope will not help anyone. When Labour fail to deliver change in living standards this will only embolden the right and drive desperate people into their hateful ideals.

They have backtracked on; the green pledge, working with unions, stopping the privatisation of the NHS, stopping austerity, protecting LGBTQIA, taxing the super rich, scrapping two child benefit cap, reintroducing the cap on bankers bonuses etc etc etc, the list goes on. (They also are refusing to up universal credit by £40 a week, increasing minimum wage to £15 an hour for all over 16, no serious rent controls) I too was once a lifelong Labour voter but they are not the party of the past. Tony Benn would not be in support of who they have become today. Whilst Starmer, Rayner and many of the other shadow cabinet members accept funds from groups like Labour Friends of Israel their priorities will not be with people and the planet. Instead their priorities are profits and power. Wealth inequality is at such a huge margin, and only set to increase under Labour as they are now, none of the next generation will be able to afford to buy homes. We are sliding back to very scary times. We have fascism in action and we know where that took the world to 100 years ago. I wish that Labour were going to offer change, but they are not going to and living under that false hope will not help anyone.

Call me uncaring or harsh, I don’t mind but no other country in the world would help us if we were in situations like Gaze, Israel or even Ukraine.  We need to think of the people in the UK. Think of what all our financial support to other countries could do for the people of the UK.  Our nhs is falling apart, our social care system is none existent, mental health services in crisis, suicides as no services to try to prevent suicide.  People using food banks , even those who are working as wages as so low.  Education failing our children and grandchildren.  Try getting a doctors appointment , cancer scans etc all in a terrible state and life’s being lost, yes not through bombs but through a system that is failing.  Our water is being polluted, bottled water for some areas, not much different to war torn countries.  Our elderly paying  extreme amounts of money for their care in care homes when they have worked and saved for years for to leave whatever they can to their families and oh boy, here we are sending money to war torn countries that could help those here in the UK.  Illegal immigration , yes, young men who say they are fleeing war, really, they arrive in France, a safe haven and then make their way to Britain, they are taking the Micky. If I was fleeing any kind of persecution, I would be overwhelmed and so thankful to reach France or the first safe place I reached.  Then we pay France 😂. Jesus you couldn’t make it up.

Think of what all our financial support to other countries could do for the people of the UK.  Our nhs is falling apart, our social care system is none existent, mental health services in crisis, suicides as no services to try to prevent suicide.  People using food banks , even those who are working as wages as so low.  Education failing our children and grandchildren.  Try getting a doctors appointment , cancer scans etc all in a terrible state and life’s being lost, yes not through bombs but through a system that is failing.  Our water is being polluted, bottled water for some areas, not much different to war torn countries.  Our elderly paying  extreme amounts of money for their care in care homes when they have worked and saved for years for to leave whatever they can to their families and oh boy, here we are sending money to war torn countries that could help those here in the UK.

The Labour motion does nothing of the sort. In particular, its motion defends the right of Israel to continue with its actions in Gaza if Hamas does not cease all its action. But, under international law, Israel has no legal justification for its continuing action in Gaza because it is no longer acting in any form of self-defence. Whilst Hamas' actions should clearly cease, and hostages should clearly be freed, the collective punishment of the people of Gaza, which the Labour motion permits if those actions do not happen, cannot be tolerated in international law, or ethically, and yet Labour is clearly indicating that it will tolerate that continued collective punishment of innocent people who have no responsibility for what Hamas does, and that is utterly unacceptable on its part.""",negative,0.8096729516983032,0.20320138335227966,2.214734922745265e-05,0.00031611035228706896,0.0005063564167357981,0.17593520879745483,3.727927105501294e-05,3.9985254261409864e-05

Reduced life expectancy to WW2 levels

Quadrupled illegal migration

I do think Labour needs a position on the 'conspiracy of silence over Brexit' accusation though. It has been proven that it has impacted our country adversely and set us back. I get that we (I'm a Labour member) don't want to go back to divisive 'leave/remain' politics, but is there a way to say 'we know that the way the Tories handled Brexit has left our country worse off, here is what we will do to remain true to the result of the referendum while improving the situation we have now...' Either way, strong performance. Now if someone on the stage can be a bit rougher on Farage and call out the racism for what it is, that would be lovely... Though perhaps it is in Labour's interest to split the right wing vote...
