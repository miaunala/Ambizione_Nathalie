From the moment H@mas carried out their heinous acts of 7/10 which were loudly celebrated in Gaza, this was only going to go one way, Israel were going to hit back hard. Regardless what anyone said that was going to happen, and trying to get Israel to follow internal law was what Keir Starmer called for at the start. When it became clear that aid was not being allowed in he called that out and when it seemed possible he called for a temporary ceasefire because that was what was possible. He has now called for a full and immediate ceasefire but with all of these Israel will do what they want with US backing.  The Greens have some decent policies but they also have some highly suspect areas and they are just not going to win, so if you want to give yourself a pat on the back for protesting and going green then great, good for you and if enough people follow you from Labour, you can look forward to another Term of the worst the Tories can though at us.....

How is the party that is meant to be for the people? Able to take money from a state which I know we all know the Labour Party would have had all the reports from their own Labour Party lawyers and amnesty international I am sure they have human rights investigations WE ALL KNOW Labour mp’s are not stupid they know they have been breaking international law and violating human rights for years yet they turn a blind eye to it and take the money 💰 anyway .

You are getting too much into the weeds of how people are linked to Israel in isolation. Israel is a key ally of the west for lots of strategic and tactical reasons, that are widely known and discussed on the web. Just think about the conflicts that Israel has faced since it was formed in 1948, it has been attacked so many times by its neighbours and has fought them all to a stand still capturing territory and equipment each time, a lot of those countries were armed by Russia/ USSR, think about that and Israel's efforts in limiting Iran's ambitions both directly and through its affiliates. Also you are looking at Israel in isolation and not considering that you could make a case for other allies such as Saudia Arabia etc. None of this excuses Israel's excesses in the conflict with Gaza but it does show why there is so much too and fro with Israel. However you should also look at how much aid has been and is provided to Gaza and Palestine by the west. Let's be fair your views on Israel come with an obvious bias and seem to blame Labour for external factors and things that they do not have direct control over i.e. they didn't start, condone or control Israel's excesses or indeed the conflict, you need to blame Netanyahu and his henchmen along with H@mas. Labour are not going to go back to it's previous stance on Israel which was riddled with anti sem1tism. I am certain that everyone in Labour is troubled by how Israel has handled this and a response, has and will come to aid and rebuild Gaza and hopefully see peace between Israel and Gaza via a two state solution which has long been needed.",2025-03-26T12:38:18.157Z,2222737179,0.0,[],"['@manchester_airbnb76', '@mas']"

Don’t be fooled if Labour were in government their stance would be the same as the current government as they have to follow the USA 🇺🇸 on foreign policy and what I am saying is it’s time for a change ! No more veto votes for the USA and definitely not to be used over 55 times for the same country and the UK should be abstaining when it comes to human rights violations and war crimes .

I don't think Labours stance would be dramatically different in government but what I highlighted in my last post were the key reasons why Israel is such a key ally to the west. I do however think they have over stepped now to such an extent that a different response to aid, rebuild and secure peace will be forthcoming. What I will also add though is that Israel's current leadership is wrong rather than the whole country or it's general role in the world. I hope and expect a change in Israel's government will come too. Israel will remain a strategic partner and ally but human rights changes will be needed. I would just flag though that H@mas will need to go, if there is to be any long lasting peace.

They have backtracked on; the green pledge, working with unions, stopping the privatisation of the NHS, stopping austerity, protecting LGBTQIA, taxing the super rich, scrapping two child benefit cap, reintroducing the cap on bankers bonuses etc etc etc, the list goes on. (They also are refusing to up universal credit by £40 a week, increasing minimum wage to £15 an hour for all over 16, no serious rent controls) I too was once a lifelong Labour voter but they are not the party of the past. Tony Benn would not be in support of who they have become today. Whilst Starmer, Rayner and many of the other shadow cabinet members accept funds from groups like Labour Friends of Israel their priorities will not be with people and the planet. Instead their priorities are profits and power. Wealth inequality is at such a huge margin, and only set to increase under Labour as they are now, none of the next generation will be able to afford to buy homes. We are sliding back to very scary times. We have fascism in action and we know where that took the world to 100 years ago. I wish that Labour were going to offer change, but they are not going to and living under that false hope will not help anyone. When Labour fail to deliver change in living standards this will only embolden the right and drive desperate people into their hateful ideals. We only have a few years to try and pull back to the left, literally our society and quite frankly the world depends on it.",2025-03-26T12:36:53.829Z,31308434306,0.0,[],['@davidwolverson']

The UK does not sell arms or weapons to Israel; it sells components for radars and electronic warfare. The information is freely available in the House of Commons library. Those such as yourself who hear a buzz phrase like 'arms sales to Israel's on social media make the assumption that British bombs and bullets are being shipped to the front line when they're not. The only thing such claims cling to is that the UK exports components globally for certain types of aircraft that Israel, amongst dozens of other nations, happens to use. So the UK is an international irrelevance to the Israeli government; Labour already voted for a ceasefire anyway; and the UK doesn't sell arms to Israel in any meaningful way.

I think that is a pretty good call, obviously a massive time for Labour, first government after the world war and a lot to deal with, they were in power from 1945 to 1951 I think and amongst the many good things they did, Attlee was also a big supporter of NATO and the work to stop the spread of communism. Famously of course Artlees gocernment were big supporters of the Jewish people and the formation of Israel, they ran the country as we ended the British Mandate and we're big supporters of the formation of Israel. Interesting that you don't think of any of the others in the same way since 1951.

Yes the country was recovering from total war, there was no political appetite for a post colonial conflict. The nascent state was an expedient, as a place to locate the survivors of the holocaust, a relatively pain free exit from occupation after a “token fight”.

It was an absolutely right  thing to do to help address the persecution of the Jewish people during and before the second world war. Labour in fact supported the formation of a Jewish state since around 1917 and continued to support Israel while it struggled for survival after 1948 and through the various wars with its neighbours. I think it was a good piece of work and very necessary, but the point I am making is that the support of Israel through all those times and to the recent past does fly in the face of some of the nonsense that some of the hard left types would post in here as if Keir Starmer invented Labours support of Israel, when he pretty much carries on a long standing tradition.

The Tories have;
Tripled national debt
Enabled wealthiest 1% to triple their wealth during Covid but not pay any more tax
Doubled NHS waiting list
Increased retirement age so workers pay years of extra tax and receive no pension
Added 33% to VAT in their first year
In their first year increased cost of petrol more than Labours entire term
Closed half of all migistrates courts causing a five year back log for violence and sexual offences
Axed half of front line prison officers and closed prisons creating the justice crisis we see today meaning rapists are walking free
Reduced life expectancy to WW2 levels
Record levels of child poverty
Quadrupled illegal migration
Squandered £150billion giving it to their mates in dodgy deals 
Cancelled all of Labours costed plans to build nuclear power stations deliberately creating fuel poverty and a reliance on coal and gas which Sunaks wife managed to get in on and made £billions
I could go on all day, the country is the worst it’s been in every aspect since records began!
They’ve destroyed the economy and millions of home owners face home repossessions because of the Tories financial mismanagement!
Under Labour I could see a dentist, doctor, get treatment on the NHS, my five year fixed mortgage was 1.3% not 5-6%. I expected to draw my pension at 65 and live into my 80s

Labour have backtracked on; the green pledge, working with unions, stopping the privatisation of the NHS, stopping austerity, protecting LGBTQIA, taxing the super rich, scrapping two child benefit cap, reintroducing the cap on bankers bonuses etc etc etc, the list goes on. (Labour also are refusing to up universal credit by £40 a week, increasing minimum wage to £15 an hour for all over 16, no serious rent controls) I was once a lifelong Labour voter but they are not the party of the past. Tony Benn would not be in support of who they have become today. Whilst you, Starmer and many of the other shadow cabinet members accept funds from groups like Labour Friends of Israel their priorities will not be with people and the planet. Instead their priorities are profits and power. Wealth inequality is at such a huge margin, and only set to increase under Labour as they are now, none of the next generation will be able to afford to buy homes. We are sliding back to very scary times. We have fascism in action and we know where that took the world to 100 years ago. I wish that Labour were going to offer change, but they are not going to and living under that false hope will not help anyone. When Labour fail to deliver change in living standards this will only embolden the right and drive desperate people into their hateful ideals. We only have a few years to try and pull back to the left, literally our society depends on it. By voting Green or independent it will show Labour that they cannot just bank on not being “as bad” as Tories to win our votes.",2025-03-26T12:33:26.370Z,31308434306,0.0,0.0,False,[],[],,,,,,,,,

Firstly he ignored the genocide for months and still hasn’t actively been seeking justice for the war crimes cause by Benjamin Netanyahu. He also demolished the Corbynite supporters including who I voted for; Rebecca Long-Bailey. Then slowly starts bringing back in some of corbyn’s previous manifesto pledges like they’re a new idea! He also treated the most respected Labour MPs, Diane Abbott and Faiza Shaheen with utter discontent AFTER praising them both. He’s a charlatan and should be ashamed of himself. It’s obvious he’s easily influenced by his peers. I chose Angela as Labour leader also, and I really hope she’ll eventually get this opportunity to be the first female Labour PM.

Hamas found that some of the hostages were disabled or had health problems & because it was too much trouble to look after them & move them around they killed them. Israell had nothing to do with Hamas gaining power. There was a democratic election & Hamas won the election & then abolished election so they could remain in power for ever. Thats Hamas for you. It was Hamas who broke the last ceasefire. But please tell me, infact telll the United Nations how you have a ceasefire when Hamas have said they would do the same again the first chance they get, they want to kill every jew & wipe Israel off the map. Theyre the people youre supporting. I feel for the Palestinian people but they elected Hamas & now cant get rid of them. There have been times Israel have gone too far but i can understand the Israeli people's anger. If the same had happened in the UK id want us to eliminate the terrorists & get the hostages back, no matter the cost. Sadly women & children get killed in warfare. Its worse in Gaza because its heavily populated. Do you think when we bombed Berlin in world war 2 no women & children got killed, the same as when other countries were liberated. Everyone in this country wants peace. But in honesty this country can say what it likes. It wont matter a jot. But Hamas started this, they have little intention of keeping to a ceasefire long term, why dont they release the remaining hostages if they want any chance of peace? Sadly the Palestinian people are paying the price. More of them have been killed because the Hamas cowards use them as human shields. Its about time the USA, UK & the rest of Europe got tough with Iran & told them if they keep sheltering terrorists from Hamas, Hezbollah etc & keep supplying them with wespons they will face consequences & i dont mean sanctions.
