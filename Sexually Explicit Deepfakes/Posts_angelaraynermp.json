From the moment H@mas carried out their heinous acts of 7/10 which were loudly celebrated in Gaza, this was only going to go one way, Israel were going to hit back hard. Regardless what anyone said that was going to happen, and trying to get Israel to follow internal law was what Keir Starmer called for at the start. When it became clear that aid was not being allowed in he called that out and when it seemed possible he called for a temporary ceasefire because that was what was possible. He has now called for a full and immediate ceasefire but with all of these Israel will do what they want with US backing.  The Greens have some decent policies but they also have some highly suspect areas and they are just not going to win, so if you want to give yourself a pat on the back for protesting and going green then great, good for you and if enough people follow you from Labour, you can look forward to another Term of the worst the Tories can though at us.....

How is the party that is meant to be for the people? Able to take money from a state which I know we all know the Labour Party would have had all the reports from their own Labour Party lawyers and amnesty international I am sure they have human rights investigations WE ALL KNOW Labour mp‚Äôs are not stupid they know they have been breaking international law and violating human rights for years yet they turn a blind eye to it and take the money üí∞ anyway .

          "text": "@manchester_airbnb76  ok so you seem like an interesting lady with a definite point of view and certainly intelligence too but although I welcome and respect your point of view but I think you are missing a couple of key points. You are getting too much into the weeds of how people are linked to Israel in isolation. Israel is a key ally of the west for lots of strategic and tactical reasons, that are widely known and discussed on the web. Just think about the conflicts that Israel has faced since it was formed in 1948, it has been attacked so many times by its neighbours and has fought them all to a stand still capturing territory and equipment each time, a lot of those countries were armed by Russia/ USSR, think about that and Israel's efforts in limiting Iran's ambitions both directly and through its affiliates. Also you are looking at Israel in isolation and not considering that you could make a case for other allies such as Saudia Arabia etc. None of this excuses Israel's excesses in the conflict with Gaza but it does show why there is so much too and fro with Israel. However you should also look at how much aid has been and is provided to Gaza and Palestine by the west. Let's be fair your views on Israel come with an obvious bias and seem to blame Labour for external factors and things that they do not have direct control over i.e. they didn't start, condone or control Israel's excesses or indeed the conflict, you need to blame Netanyahu and his henchmen along with H@mas. Labour are not going to go back to it's previous stance on Israel which was riddled with anti sem1tism. I am certain that everyone in Labour is troubled by how Israel has handled this and a response, has and will come to aid and rebuild Gaza and hopefully see peace between Israel and Gaza via a two state solution which has long been needed.",

I don't think Labours stance would be dramatically different in government but what I highlighted in my last post were the key reasons why Israel is such a key ally to the west. I do however think they have over stepped now to such an extent that a different response to aid, rebuild and secure peace will be forthcoming. What I will also add though is that Israel's current leadership is wrong rather than the whole country or it's general role in the world. I hope and expect a change in Israel's government will come too. Israel will remain a strategic partner and ally but human rights changes will be needed. I would just flag though that H@mas will need to go, if there is to be any long lasting peace. Have a great rest of weekend and holiday.",

The problem was created through the selling of council owned properties leading to private landlords snapping up any cheap properties and charging extortion rents which prevent families being able to break the cycle and save for a deposit. In one day alone in a small railway town in the NE of England a london based firm bought 107 houses without viewing with the aim to rent. No starter homes/houses left in the town for young/ low wage people to access. So why not look at what‚Äôs being built and why rather than just throwing more houses up for the sake of it.",

The ordinary people of this country can't stand another 5 years of the Tories and don't want extemism or posturing, we need to actually win.

They have backtracked on; the green pledge, working with unions, stopping the privatisation of the NHS, stopping austerity, protecting LGBTQIA, taxing the super rich, scrapping two child benefit cap, reintroducing the cap on bankers bonuses etc etc etc, the list goes on. (They also are refusing to up universal credit by ¬£40 a week, increasing minimum wage to ¬£15 an hour for all over 16, no serious rent controls) I too was once a lifelong Labour voter but they are not the party of the past. Tony Benn would not be in support of who they have become today. Whilst Starmer, Rayner and many of the other shadow cabinet members accept funds from groups like Labour Friends of Israel their priorities will not be with people and the planet. Instead their priorities are profits and power. Wealth inequality is at such a huge margin, and only set to increase under Labour as they are now, none of the next generation will be able to afford to buy homes. We are sliding back to very scary times. We have fascism in action and we know where that took the world to 100 years ago. I wish that Labour were going to offer change, but they are not going to and living under that false hope will not help anyone. When Labour fail to deliver change in living standards this will only embolden the right and drive desperate people into their hateful ideals. We only have a few years to try and pull back to the left, literally our society and quite frankly the world depends on it.",

The point being that Starmer has to react to changing times and circumstances. The country has changed enormously since that election. And he (or any other politician) has to react to those changes. Look at the damage the Cabbage did to the economy and the fuck up the Tories have made of Brexit. Both huge game changers. At the end of the day, he has a whole country to try to win over, not just Party Membership. 400k members can't take precedent over the views to 35m eligible voters. Look at it from the Mao perspective, gain influence from within, like a fish through water.",

Arms exports is a completely separate issue but has an equally irrelevant position when it comes to the UK. The UK does not sell arms or weapons to Israel; it sells components for radars and electronic warfare. The information is freely available in the House of Commons library. Those such as yourself who hear a buzz phrase like 'arms sales to Israel's on social media make the assumption that British bombs and bullets are being shipped to the front line when they're not. The only thing such claims cling to is that the UK exports components globally for certain types of aircraft that Israel, amongst dozens of other nations, happens to use. So the UK is an international irrelevance to the Israeli government; Labour already voted for a ceasefire anyway; and the UK doesn't sell arms to Israel in any meaningful way. Do you have any actual arguments that hold water as to how and why Angela Rayner is responsible for the deaths of Gazans? You yourself are probably more complicit through your use of Israeli patented and manufactured electronics and healthcare products.",

Call me uncaring or harsh, I don‚Äôt mind but no other country in the world would help us if we were in situations like Gaze, Israel or even Ukraine.  We need to think of the people in the UK. Think of what all our financial support to other countries could do for the people of the UK.  Our nhs is falling apart, our social care system is none existent, mental health services in crisis, suicides as no services to try to prevent suicide.  People using food banks , even those who are working as wages as so low.  Education failing our children and grandchildren.  Try getting a doctors appointment , cancer scans etc all in a terrible state and life‚Äôs being lost, yes not through bombs but through a system that is failing.  Our water is being polluted, bottled water for some areas, not much different to war torn countries.  Our elderly paying  extreme amounts of money for their care in care homes when they have worked and saved for years for to leave whatever they can to their families and oh boy, here we are sending money to war torn countries that could help those here in the UK.  Illegal immigration , yes, young men who say they are fleeing war, really, they arrive in France, a safe haven and then make their way to Britain, they are taking the Micky. If I was fleeing any kind of persecution, I would be overwhelmed and so thankful to reach France or the first safe place I reached.  Then we pay France üòÇ. Jesus you couldn‚Äôt make it up.

The U.K. has a big part in the cause of the issues in Gaza and a responsibility in my opinion to put things right I refer to the Balfour declaration from 1917 when the British government at the time gave away the Palestinians land to the Zionist Jewish. We had no right to do this and the Zionist ever since have taken more and more land by force. The people of Gaza live behind a wall built by the Zionist jews creating a prison/concentration camp. The problems in our country are caused by the same people that back the Zionist regime occupying Gaza, the same ones who were giving their friend‚Äôs fraudulent vip contracts during covid. The same people who allow the big corporations to put our bills up claiming it‚Äôs a cost of living crisis whilst the corporations earn record profits .

But, under international law, Israel has no legal justification for its continuing action in Gaza because it is no longer acting in any form of self-defence. Whilst Hamas' actions should clearly cease, and hostages should clearly be freed, the collective punishment of the people of Gaza, which the Labour motion permits if those actions do not happen, cannot be tolerated in international law, or ethically, and yet Labour is clearly indicating that it will tolerate that continued collective punishment of innocent people who have no responsibility for what Hamas does, and that is utterly unacceptable on its part.\"",

I think that is a pretty good call, obviously a massive time for Labour, first government after the world war and a lot to deal with, they were in power from 1945 to 1951 I think and amongst the many good things they did, Attlee was also a big supporter of NATO and the work to stop the spread of communism. Famously of course Artlees gocernment were big supporters of the Jewish people and the formation of Israel, they ran the country as we ended the British Mandate and we're big supporters of the formation of Israel. Interesting that you don't think of any of the others in the same way since 1951. Thanks though, interesting to talk things through and sorry for my initial response.",

It was an absolutely right  thing to do to help address the persecution of the Jewish people during and before the second world war. Labour in fact supported the formation of a Jewish state since around 1917 and continued to support Israel while it struggled for survival after 1948 and through the various wars with its neighbours. I think it was a good piece of work and very necessary, but the point I am making is that the support of Israel through all those times and to the recent past does fly in the face of some of the nonsense that some of the hard left types would post in here as if Keir Starmer invented Labours support of Israel, when he pretty much carries on a long standing tradition. He backed their right to respond to Hamas but has obviously changed position when it became evident that Netanyahu and co were not respecting international law.",

It has been proven that it has impacted our country adversely and set us back. I get that we (I'm a Labour member) don't want to go back to divisive 'leave/remain' politics, but is there a way to say 'we know that the way the Tories handled Brexit has left our country worse off, here is what we will do to remain true to the result of the referendum while improving the situation we have now...' Either way, strong performance. Now if someone on the stage can be a bit rougher on Farage and call out the racism for what it is, that would be lovely... Though perhaps it is in Labour's interest to split the right wing vote... It just doesn't sit right, that man who said Brexit was delivered \"without a shot fired\" so soon after Jo Cox's murder having a platform.",

Labour have backtracked on; the green pledge, working with unions, stopping the privatisation of the NHS, stopping austerity, protecting LGBTQIA, taxing the super rich, scrapping two child benefit cap, reintroducing the cap on bankers bonuses etc etc etc, the list goes on. (Labour also are refusing to up universal credit by ¬£40 a week, increasing minimum wage to ¬£15 an hour for all over 16, no serious rent controls) I was once a lifelong Labour voter but they are not the party of the past. Tony Benn would not be in support of who they have become today. Whilst you, Starmer and many of the other shadow cabinet members accept funds from groups like Labour Friends of Israel their priorities will not be with people and the planet. Instead their priorities are profits and power. Wealth inequality is at such a huge margin, and only set to increase under Labour as they are now, none of the next generation will be able to afford to buy homes. We are sliding back to very scary times. We have fascism in action and we know where that took the world to 100 years ago. I wish that Labour were going to offer change, but they are not going to and living under that false hope will not help anyone. When Labour fail to deliver change in living standards this will only embolden the right and drive desperate people into their hateful ideals. We only have a few years to try and pull back to the left, literally our society depends on it. By voting Green or independent it will show Labour that they cannot just bank on not being ‚Äúas bad‚Äù as Tories to win our votes.",

Firstly he ignored the genocide for months and still hasn‚Äôt actively been seeking justice for the war crimes cause by Benjamin Netanyahu. He also demolished the Corbynite supporters including who I voted for; Rebecca Long-Bailey. Then slowly starts bringing back in some of corbyn‚Äôs previous manifesto pledges like they‚Äôre a new idea! He also treated the most respected Labour MPs, Diane Abbott and Faiza Shaheen with utter discontent AFTER praising them both. He‚Äôs a charlatan and should be ashamed of himself.

Soooo the little bit of tax the Tories save ordinary working people (masses more for the richer) will hardly touch the charges made by these companies for delivering the, once, publicly owned services.  Profit will make some individuals obscenely rich or pay dividends to shareholders- never to be seen again by you or I.  And these companies and individuals are past masters at avoiding/ evading taxes. A great system for transferring wealth into a minority of pockets and leaving nothing for you and me.  The latest Tory depiction of Starmer is the usual emotive propoganda believed by so many:-( Tory PRIVATISATION will cost us FAR, FAR MORE üò≠üò≠ MY MUM WILL PAY NEARLY ¬£70,000 THIS YEAR IN HER CARE HOME.

Soooo the little bit of tax the Tories save ordinary working people (masses more for the richer) will hardly touch the charges made by these companies for delivering the, once, publicly owned services.  Profit will make some individuals obscenely rich or pay dividends to shareholders- never to be seen again by you or I.  And these companies and individuals are past masters at avoiding/ evading taxes. A great system for transferring wealth into a minority of pockets and leaving nothing for you and me.  The latest Tory depiction of Starmer is the usual emotive propoganda believed by so many:-( Tory PRIVATISATION will cost us FAR, FAR MORE üò≠üò≠ MY MUM WILL PAY NEARLY ¬£70,000 THIS YEAR IN HER CARE HOME.

It is only in some European countries that people are lazy. They know they can't compete with the rest of the world. That's why they are against free enterprise. They know in the private sector, they will be fired. No wonder most of the innovations are happening either in the US or in Asia. Europe is like a fossil. Brits have child tax credit! What a joke. Why will taxpayers pay for having kids? The socialists want to abolish the 2 kids' limit. This only allows people to stay at home and claim benefits while having kids. Except life threatening medical treatment and emergency services, a government shouldn't be providing any service. Let people earn and they can afford themselves. Reward brilliance, entrepreneurship and risk taking.",

Labour have called for a ceasefire but were right in the beginning to say Israel had a right to defend themselves. You people seem to forget it was Hamas who invaded Israel & murdered over 1200 people, committing all sort of atrocities against them + they took around 300 hostages & still hold over 100, having killed some. So being as youre such a genius how are you going to solve it? Are you saying if terrorists did something similar in the UK you wouldnt want us to retaliate & get our hostages back?",

Hamas found that some of the hostages were disabled or had health problems & because it was too much trouble to look after them & move them around they killed them. Israell had nothing to do with Hamas gaining power. There was a democratic election & Hamas won the election & then abolished election so they could remain in power for ever. Thats Hamas for you. It was Hamas who broke the last ceasefire. But please tell me, infact telll the United Nations how you have a ceasefire when Hamas have said they would do the same again the first chance they get, they want to kill every jew & wipe Israel off the map. Theyre the people youre supporting. I feel for the Palestinian people but they elected Hamas & now cant get rid of them. There have been times Israel have gone too far but i can understand the Israeli people's anger. If the same had happened in the UK id want us to eliminate the terrorists & get the hostages back, no matter the cost. Sadly women & children get killed in warfare. Its worse in Gaza because its heavily populated. Do you think when we bombed Berlin in world war 2 no women & children got killed, the same as when other countries were liberated. Everyone in this country wants peace. But in honesty this country can say what it likes. It wont matter a jot. But Hamas started this, they have little intention of keeping to a ceasefire long term, why dont they release the remaining hostages if they want any chance of peace? Sadly the Palestinian people are paying the price. More of them have been killed because the Hamas cowards use them as human shields. Its about time the USA, UK & the rest of Europe got tough with Iran & told them if they keep sheltering terrorists from Hamas, Hezbollah etc & keep supplying them with wespons they will face consequences & i dont mean sanctions. I mean military action",

Hamas were \"elected\" 20 fucking years ago, in an election marred by intimidation, at a time when most currently alive Gazans weren't even old enough to vote. And if a fascist foreign state murdered your innocent family members, don't you think that would radicalise you to the extent that you would support the group who were most violently opposed to that country?

But doesnt think Ukraine should defend theirs. But as everything with reform its someone else's fault. Its the West & NATO's fault. I cant remember any of them invading Ukraine. But then those 2 vile campaigners for Farage spouted racist, homophobic comments & it was Channel 4's fault. Despite the fact one of them was a friend of Farage, so he knew exactly what he was like. Farage lied to everyone over brexit that is costing the UK over ¬£4 billion a year & rising. So to believe him again makes reform voters very gullible or very stupid.

Labour will be better than the Tories that is a given and I look forward to having them running the country. But we need them to be a bigger change, some stuff they're proposing is good but it still feels lackluster.
